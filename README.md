# ARMOR
ARMOR's Implementation

# Usage
- For benchmark experiments on CIFAR-10, run:
  - python armor_udr_cifar10.py for generalization of UDR with our $ARMOR_D$ method
  - python armor_mart_cifar10.py for generalization of MART with our $ARMOR_D$ method
  - python armor_trades_cifar10.py for generalization of TRADES with our $ARMOR_D$ method
